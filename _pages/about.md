Further, the concepts and technologies covered include those that facilitate the operation of and customer access to these services, including on-board and customer hardware and software, information systems, applications (e.g., smartphone ormobile applications that provide real-time information or allow customers to ridehail), and communication technologies. Finally, the committee covers the impact of these services and technologies on communities and travelers.
