title: Computational Transportation Engineer - Postdoctoral Appointee
organization: Argonne National Laboratory
description: The Transportation Systems and Mobility Group at the Argonne National Laboratory is hiring a postdoctoral candidate to support our high-performance large-scale agent-based transportation tool called POLARIS. The goals of such simulations are to analyze the potential impacts of future mobility technologies such as shared-autonomous vehicles operating in fleets, vehicle electrification, new freight delivery technologies, and others. We seek to understand the potential impacts and radically improve the mobility and energy sustainability of transportation. Decision-makers at the federal, state and regional levels rely on such simulation models to make decisions on investments and management strategies.
